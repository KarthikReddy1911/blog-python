<h3>Unlocking Efficiency with Python in Design Verification</h3>

            <p>Verification engineers face stringent deadlines and are tasked with delivering faultless digital designs. Manual execution of repetitive tasks, such as test case generation or simulation runs, not only consumes valuable time but also increases the likelihood of human errors. Python’s simplicity, flexibility, and powerful libraries make it an invaluable asset for automating these tasks, enabling engineers to focus on critical aspects of design verification.</p> 
<p>For students and aspirants aiming to build careers in hardware verification, understanding Python’s role in streamlining verification workflows is invaluable.</p>

            <h3>What is Scripting?</h3>
            <p>Scripting involves creating lightweight programs to automate repetitive tasks in workflows. Unlike full-scale applications, scripts focus on specific tasks, such as file manipulation or command execution. Popular scripting languages include Bash, Perl, Ruby, and Python, with Python’s versatility making it particularly suitable for hardware verification.</p>

            <h3>A Real-World Example: Automating Directory Setup</h3>
            <pre><code>
import os

def setup_test_environment(base_path, test_cases):
    if not os.path.exists(base_path):
        os.makedirs(base_path)

    for test_case in test_cases:
        path = os.path.join(base_path, test_case)
        if not os.path.exists(path):
            os.makedirs(path)
            print(f"Created directory: {path}")

# Define base path and test case names
base_path = "./test_env"
test_cases = ["test_1", "test_2", "test_3"]

setup_test_environment(base_path, test_cases)</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Expected Output in Terminal:</strong></p>
<pre>
Created directory: ./test_env/test_1
Created directory: ./test_env/test_2
Created directory: ./test_env/test_3</pre>
            <p><strong>Resulting Directory Structure:</strong></p>
            <pre>
./test_env/
    /test_1/
    /test_2/
    /test_3/</pre>
            <p>This script automates a task verification engineers frequently encounter—setting up environments for multiple test cases.</p>

            <h3>Running the Script in Linux</h3>
            <p>Python scripts are platform-agnostic, making them ideal for automation in Linux environments. To execute the script:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Save the Python script to a file, e.g., setup_env.py.</li>
                <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the script’s directory.</li>
                <li>Run the script:</li>
                <pre><code>python3 setup_env.py</code></pre>
                <li>Verify the output and check the directory structure.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>            
            <h3>Example: Parsing Simulation Logs</h3>
            <pre><code>
def parse_logs(log_file):
    with open(log_file, "r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            if "ERROR" in line:
                print(f"Error found: {line.strip()}")

# Sample log file
log_file_path = "./test_env/test_1/simulation.log"
with open(log_file_path, "w") as log:
    log.write("INFO: Simulation started\n")
    log.write("ERROR: Signal mismatch detected\n")
    log.write("INFO: Simulation ended\n")

# Parse the log file
parse_logs(log_file_path)</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Expected Output:</strong></p>
            <pre>Error found: ERROR: Signal mismatch detected</pre>
            <p>This demonstrates how Python can automate debugging by quickly identifying issues in simulation logs.</p>
